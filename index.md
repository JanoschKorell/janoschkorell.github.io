### App - Predict text with text from party speeches

This app was created with dash and plotly so that interactions and inputs are possible. With it, it is possible to predict text with LSTM models trained with speeches of politicians from the German Bundestag. This is part of a larger project: "Bundestag in data". You can ask a question to three models at the same time and get different answers from different parties.

### Textmining - Scraping individual politicians speeches


Script to scrape the speeches in order of time, in order and by speaker from the plenary transcripts.
I made this with regex strategies.

### Machine Learning - Use LSTMs to learn rules of speeches


With this script, LSTMs were used to learn the rules of politicians' speeches from the Bundestag and their partisan context. This way, text can be generated through queries that reflect the nature of the respective party.

### Research project - Determinants of the perception of justice in Europe


Logistic multilevel regression with Stata; Descriptive statistics, level 1 and level 2 hypotheses.

This work is in the field of empirical justice research and aimed to explain determinants of perceptions of justice in Europe. Due to data protection reasons, only the STATA code can be published.

### Web scraping - Twitter scraper without API


Because the previous ways to do data mining on Twitter are limited to sometimes poorly functioning libraries using the Twitter API, I wrote a piece of code over which I have my own control and for which no API is necessary.

### Plots - STATA Plots


This repository is to show my understanding of how data is represented. The plots have been chosen according to the structure of the data. For the programming of the plots STATA was used. You can view these files to also see my skills in programming STATA.
