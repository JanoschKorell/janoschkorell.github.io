### App - Predict text with text from party speeches

This app was created with dash and plotly so that interactions and inputs are possible. With it, it is possible to predict text with LSTM models trained with speeches of politicians from the German Bundestag. This is part of a larger project: "Bundestag in data". You can ask a question to three models at the same time and get different answers from different parties.

### Textmining - Scraping individual politicians speeches


Script to scrape the speeches in order of time, in order and by speaker from the plenary transcripts.
I made this with regex strategies.

### Machine Learning - Use LSTMs to learn rules of speeches


With this script, LSTMs were used to learn the rules of politicians' speeches from the Bundestag and their partisan context. This way, text can be generated through queries that reflect the nature of the respective party.
